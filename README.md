The purpose of the Alpha Omicron Pi (AOII)Website is to create a platform where members of the organization and those interested in the organization are able to find/view the most up to date information about the sorority. It not only serves as a great tool to learn more about AOII but also benefits the organization in being able to advertise their events and opportunities through the calendar and photo gallery that has been implemented. The website is intended to contain information about the organization, photos advertising the organization, and a calendar which displays upcoming events for anyone that is a part of AOII or interested persons.
